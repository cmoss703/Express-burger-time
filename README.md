## DESCRIPTION

An app that lets you create and then eat burgers in "real" time using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM! 

This app looks, tastes, and smells like a burger (you might have to take my word for it, since technology isn't quite there yet). Yum!

## INSTALLATION

First, download the files from this repository, then open the terminal. Inside the folder, use 'npm init' to initialize npm package, then 'npm i' to install dependencies. 

Navigate to the db folder and get into the mysql command line. Here you can call 'source schema.sql' and 'source seeds.sql' to run the mysql databse.

Your project is ready for use!

## USAGE

This application is invoked by entering 'node index.js' into the terminal. Then navigating to the localhost server specified in the app (Port 8080).

Alternatively, you can just click [this link, to be brought to the deployed Heroku app.](https://cmoss-burger-time.herokuapp.com/)
